# Quesa
Quesa is a high-level, Open Source, 3D graphics library that offers binary and source level compatibility with Apple's QuickDrawâ„¢ 3D API. Quesa does not contain any Apple source code, and was developed without access to Apple's QD3D implementation. Quesa has some APIs and capabilities that were not present in QD3D.

Quesa supports both retained and immediate mode rendering, an extensible file format, plug-in renderers, a wide range of high level geometries, hierarchical models, and a consistent and object-orientated API.

Quesa acts as a scene-graph while using OpenGL for rendering. In principle it could be adapted to use a different low-level rendering engine such as Direct 3D.

Also see the [summary page at SourceForge](http://quesa.sourceforge.net/) for another view of Quesa resources.

## What platforms does Quesa support?

Quesa currently supports Mac OS 8/9, Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows. Images of Quesa running on various platforms can be found on [the screenshots page](http://quesa.sourceforge.net/info/screenshots.html).

## How do you pronounce Quesa?

Quesa is pronounced kes-ah. Think Quesadilla, without the dia.
